## Future Improvements
To improve this project for future iterations, we would like to imporve styling and responsiveness. We also need to finish the checkout process with the Stripe API, which proved to be too complicated for us to finish within the time allotted.


## Process and Planning
We broke into two pairs to tackle the front end and the back end separately for the first two days, then spent a lot of time as a group programming database and Stripe API integrations and styling. We generally had one team member at the helm performing the coding while the rest of the team did research and made suggestions along the way. When we ran into problems, we tested a lot of different permutations to make our code run, but eventually filled out issues for problems that left us stuck.
